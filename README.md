# PyBer_Analysis
Overview of Analysis
V. Isualize has Omar and I with this assignment. I am to use Python skills and knowledge of Pandas to create a summary Dataframe of the ride-sharing data by city type. After creating this Dataframe, I am to use Pandas and Matplotlib to create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. This will then allow me to submit a report to summarize how the data differs by city type and how those differences may be used stakeholders at PyBer.
